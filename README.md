# Anthropic's AI Model Gains Computer Control in New Upgrade

Anthropic has released an upgraded version of its AI model Claude 3.5 Sonnet and announced a new model, Claude 3.5 Haiku, alongside a public beta feature enabling AI to operate computers like humans. The enhanced Sonnet model improved its coding capabilities, scoring 49% on the SWEbench Verified benchmark, surpassing OpenAI and other competitors. The Haiku model matches the performance of Anthropic's previous flagship Claude 3 Opus while maintaining lower costs and faster speeds. The computer use feature, available through Anthropic's API and cloud partners, allows Claude to perform tasks like navigating web browsers, filling forms, and manipulating data. Early adopters include Asana, DoorDash, and Replit, though Anthropic -- backed by investors including Google and Amazon -- acknowledges the feature remains experimental and error-prone. Claude 3.5 Haiku will launch later this month, initially supporting text-only inputs with image capabilities to follow.
